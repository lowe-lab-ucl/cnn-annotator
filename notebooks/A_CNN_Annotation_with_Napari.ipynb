    "# CNN Image Annotation with Napari\n",
    "\n",
    "### Welcome! \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook allows you to import your raw microscopy data into [_Napari_](https://napari.org/ \"Napari: a fast, interactive, multi-dimensional image viewer for Python\"), a fast, interactive, multi-dimensional image viewer for Python. Follow the step-wise instructions to annotate your large, multi-dimensional images and extract single-cell image patches corresponding to different states of the cell cycle. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a preview of the *napari* interface for image annotations:\n",
    "![image](../napari_annotator.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running Instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To run this notebook, go to ```Kernel``` and click on ```Restart & Run All```. Alternatively, for a shortcut, click on the ```⏭️ ``` in the top dashboard. It's the icon right next to the ```Run ▶️```, ``` ⏹️```, ``` 🔁``` and the ```Code``` dropdown window. This will restart the notebook & run all of its cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Calling the last cell will start a separate Python window with the *napari* widget. Please allow a few seconds to load the graphical user interface (GUI) to load. You should see your movie loaded on the screen, such as here:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Make sure you have the latest version of *napari* installed in your virtual environment. If in doubt, run ```pip install napari -U``` for installing the upgrade. \n",
    "- Do not forget to export your annotation zip file before terminating the session. The annotations will not be autosaved nor exported automatically, so failing to export your annotations will result in your work being lost!\n",

    "## Annotating the Single-Cell Image Patches:\n",
    "\n",
    "To train a neural network to automatically and accurately classify previously unseen single-cell images, we need to manually annotate a handful of such image patches with a label. This is because the learning approach we use to train such a network is *supervised* (by a human annotator) - this means that for the learning algorithm to master the patterns representative for each class, we need to provide some of the images with the correct answer, often referred to as the *'ground truth'*. This allows the network to make high-fidelity predictions about previously unseen images.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, a random sample of labeled images needs to be provided by annotating any microscopy movie of choice. The rule of thumb is that the more examples you can generate the better. We recommend to label at least **100 instances per each class** for reasonably accurate training. Using the guide below, please annotate each image with one of the five labels provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some examples of cells and their corresponding labels:\n",
    "![image](../cell_cycle_states.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Annotation Instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Annotate your movie by clicking on the individual instances of the labels you wish to annotate. Although there is no sub-pixels targetting accuracy required at this stage, please aim to click at the centre of each cell / nucleus to allow the image patches to be cropped around those coordinates properly. The default labels is *interphase*.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Change the labels for which you wish to annotate at the bottom left corner of the GUI by choosing the appropriate label from the dropdown menu. There should be 5 labels available: *interphase (default), prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase and apoptosis*. You can swiftly change between the class labels by pressing ```.``` or ```,``` keyboard key for the next or previous label, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. When done annotating one image, you can move to the next image by clicking on the ```right arrow``` or ```left arrow``` keyboard key. If this doesn't change the slide in the current view, click on the progress bar / track slider to activate this feature. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. In case of mis-clicking on a cell you wish not to include in the annotations, to erase a point from the annotations list, choose the ```Delete point``` button at the top left corner of the GUI. You can also choose a ```Multi-point selection``` and delete the unwanted points in bulk. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. When done annotating, export the annotation file by clicking the ```Export``` button at the very bottom right corner of the GUI. **Do not forget to export your annotations before terminating the session. The annotations will not be autosaved nor exported automatically.** \n",
    "\n",
    "6. *Have you exported the annotations?* Close the GUI by clicking on the red ```X``` to quit the python GUI completely. *Optional:* If using OS X, choose to 'Force quit' the napari window for completeness. Doing so will cause this notebook's kernel to die. That's perfectly fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "**Happy annotating!**\n",
