Welcome to our [CNN Annotator repository](https://github.com/lowe-lab-ucl/cnn-annotator "CNN Annotator repository || Lowe Lab UCL") where you can find our recent *protocol* on how to use a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify time-lapse microscopy single-cell images patches according to live-cell chromatin morphology.

**Wondering what such pipeline could be used for?** Check out our recent publications where we made use of CNNs for classifying cells in live-cell imaging:

### How to navigate this repository

We provide a detailed walk-through for annotating live-cell microscopy images and training CNN model to infer classification labels on previously unseen images. Here is an overview of the entire process:

For more detailed instructions on how to annotate your microscopy data, train the CNN classifier and infer labels on previously unseen images, please refer to [this step-wise manual](/notebooks/README.md "Protocol Methods").

Please use these links to proceed with the training and inference of your CNN models in the **Google Colab** environment:

Recently, advances in machine learning have enabled researchers to automatically classify chromatin morphology in fluorescence microscopy images. In this protocol, we develop user-friendly tools to perform this task. We provide an open-source annotation tool, and a cloud-based computational framework to train and utilize a convolutional neural network to automatically classify chromatin morphology. Using cloud compute enables users without significant resources or computational experience to use a machine learning approach to analyze their own microscopy data.",
